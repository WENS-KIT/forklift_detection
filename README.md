In this paper, a method is proposed to perform consistent detection of small objects across all altitudes using UAVs. Unlike traditional tiling algorithms that detect small objects with a fixed number of tiles, our method dynamically adjusts the number of tiles based on the altitude and the size of the bounding box. This approach determines the proper number of tiles for detecting small objects at each altitude. Real-time object detection was conducted on the AI board mounted on the UAV, and for this purpose, the model was optimized using a lightweighting process. Using the Visdrone dataset, the performance of small object detection at each altitude was tested in real-world conditions. Compared to the conventional YOLOv5 and fixed-number tiling algorithms, our method consistently detected small objects at all altitudes.
